# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game written in JavaScript and played on the browser console. 

- The user gets prompted for a choice (cancelling ends the game, empty choice refreshes the prompt)
- This choice is then played against a random choice made by the browser. The result is displayed on the console.
- This is repeated over five rounds
- At the end the scores are printed to the console.

(I might add a frontend to this later.)
